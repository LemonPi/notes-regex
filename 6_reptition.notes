    Optional
-----------------------------------------------------------
- ? means 0 or 1 of the previous token
- make several tokens optional by grouping with parenthesis
	eg. Nov(ember)?
- equivalent to {0,1}
- is greedy
	- always try to match first
	eg. Feb 23(rd)? for "Today is Feb 23rd, 2003" will match Feb 23rd and not Feb 23
- make lazy by putting another question mark after
