    Overview

- pretty much have to support unicode now
- most engines treat any single Unicode <code point> as a single character
	eg. Ã  is 2 code points: U+0061 (a) followed by U+0300 (grave accent)
		- . will only match a
		- but also it can be encoded as U+00E0 (a with grave accent)
			- existence is due to historical character sets
- any non-combining mark code point can be followed by any number of combining marks
	- U+0300 is a combining mark
	- results in a single <grapheme>
- match a single grapheme with \X
	- unicode version of dot
	- always matches line break characters though
	- works in Perl, PCRE, PHP, Boost, Ruby 2.0, JGS
	- other flavours need \P{M}\p{M}*+
- match a specific code point
	- \uFFFF
		- 4 hex digits in FFFF
	- \x{FFFF}
		- for Perl, PCRE, Boost, std::regex
