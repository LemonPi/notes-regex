    Conditional
-----------------------------------------------------------
- (?ifthen|else) syntax
- if construct can be a lookaround or a number indicating a capturing group
	- test whether the capturing group took part in match so far
	eg. (a)?b(?(1)c|d) tests whether a was matched
- anything can be in then and else
- only use if you have to use one regex
	- better to build branching logic into calling code if available
